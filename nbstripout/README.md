# Jupyter Notebook Strip out Tools 

Here you will find a few very fast implementations of the jupyter notebook strip out tools. 

They focus on being fast git strip out filters, without much else.

As of this writing `nbstripout-fast` and `nbstripout-jq` are respectively 13 and 9 times faster than `nbstripout` with the notebooks I tested them with. 

If you need the full functionality see [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout).
